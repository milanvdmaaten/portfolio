      ## Roomplanner, part of Floorplanner


      Roomplanner is an extension of Floorplanner. A platform, based around a floor plan editor that runs in every browser. The tool gives users the ability to make great looking architectural visualisations of their home and interior in an easy and accessible way. Floorplanner was the first fully browser-based 2D & 3D planner, and since then over 25 million users worldwide have registered for a account and in together created over 40 million plans and a multitude of great 2D & 3D images.


      Roomplanner is embedded within home and living product webshops. Users use Roomplanner to view the webshops' products in a room they created themselves.

      ## Adding step 1 to the step indicator


      When opening Roomplanner, users pick a room type which is followed by step 2: selecting a room shape. A step indicator shows the current step to the user. However, this indicator is missing at step 1, which implies the user starts at step 2. That's why we added the step indicator to step 1 as well.

      ## Indicators for interactive elements


      At step 2 users are asked to select a room shape, followed by step 3: the room configurator in which windows can be added and dimensions of the room can be set. Step 2 and 3 offer the possibility to add windows and doors to the room. However, test results showed that no participant made use of this functionality. That's why indicators were added to the elements that could be manipulated on the screen.

      ## 1 Task per step


      In general, the onboarding lacks of focus, and some functionalities are difficult to find. That's why we divided the onboarding in 5 steps. Each step focuses on one specific task which increases a users' focus within a specific step.
