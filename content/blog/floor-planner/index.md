      ## Roomplanner, part of Floorplanner


      Roomplanner is an extension of Floorplanner. A platform, based around a floor plan editor that runs in every browser. The tool gives users the ability to make great looking architectural visualisations of their home and interior in an easy and accessible way. Floorplanner was the first fully browser-based 2D & 3D planner, and since then over 25 million users worldwide have registered for a account and in together created over 40 million plans and a multitude of great 2D & 3D images.


      Roomplanner is embedded within home and living product webshops. Users use Roomplanner to view the webshops' products in a room they created themselves.

    title: The challenge
    body: >-
      There are several challenges we solved during this project. First, the
      tool is not very user-friendly, a lot of functionalities are spread over
      the tool without any hierarchy. Next to that, the visual style of
      Roomplanner doesn't fit the style of the webshops. Finally, the relevance
      for webshops to embed Roomplanner within their webshop is to generate
      leads. However, users don't see the point of leaving behind their email
      address.


      In order to solve these challenges, we conducted user interviews with the target audience of Roomplanner.

      ## Adding step 1 to the step indicator


      When opening Roomplanner, users pick a room type which is followed by step 2: selecting a room shape. A step indicator shows the current step to the user. However, this indicator is missing at step 1, which implies that users start the onboarding at step 2. That's why we added the step indicator to step 1 as well.

    body: "At step 2 users are asked to select a room shape, followed by step 3: the
      room configurator in which windows can be added and dimensions of the room
      can be set. Step 2 and 3 offer the possibility to add windows and doors to
      the room shape. However, the test results showed that no participant made
      use of this functionality. That's why indicators were added to the
      elements that could be manipulated on the screen, which trigger the user
      to play with the shape and position of the elements on the screen."

    body: In general, the onboarding lacks of focus and some functionalities were
      not found by the participants. That's why we divided the onboarding in 5
      steps. Each step focuses on one goal which increases a users' focus within
      a specific step.

      ## Adding focus to the homescreen


      Users don't expect to change the roomshape once they finished the onboarding. It’s a process they’ve completed, so why doing it again?


      That's why we moved this functionality from the home screen to 'room settings' in the menu. This contributes to goal of the homescreen; furnishing and styling the room.

      ## Replacing icons with labels


      The interview results showed that participants were clicking back and forth between the menu items, because the icons didn't speak for themselves. That's why we replaced the icons with labels.

      ## 2D is edit mode, 3D is view mode


      Another insight we gained was that users expect to move furniture in 2D and 3D mode. The difference between the two is that the 3D mode is a view only, and doesn't offer the possibility to move furniture. The switch component implies that 2D and 3D offer the same functionalities because they're presented next to each other. That's why we removed the '2D' label, because this is the default mode in which users are already editing. Next to that, we changed the label from '3D' to '3D view' which makes the functionality more clear.
