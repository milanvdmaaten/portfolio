      ## Roomplanner, part of Floorplanner


      Roomplanner is an extension of Floorplanner. A platform, based around a floor plan editor that runs in every browser. The tool gives users the ability to make great looking architectural visualisations of their home and interior in an easy and accessible way. Floorplanner was the first fully browser-based 2D & 3D planner, and since then over 25 million users worldwide have registered for a account and in together created over 40 million plans and a multitude of great 2D & 3D images.


      Roomplanner is embedded within home and living product webshops. Users use Roomplanner to view the webshops' products in a room they created themselves.

    title: The challenge
    body: >-
      There are several challenges we solved during this project. First, the
      tool is not very user-friendly, a lot of functionalities are spread over
      the tool without any hierarchy. Next to that, the visual style of
      Roomplanner doesn't fit the style of the webshops. Finally, the relevance
      for webshops to embed Roomplanner within their webshop is to generate
      leads. However, users don't see the point of leaving behind their email
      address.


      In order to solve these challenges, we conducted user interviews with the target audience of Roomplanner.

      ## Adding step 1 to the step indicator


      When opening Roomplanner, users pick a room type which is followed by step 2: selecting a room shape. A step indicator shows the current step to the user. However, this indicator is missing at step 1, which implies that users start the onboarding at step 2. That's why we added the step indicator to step 1 as well.
