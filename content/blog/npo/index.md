      on-demand tv. Their goal is to connect and enrich the Dutch public with
      programmes that inform, inspire and entertain.

      ## From a generic to a personal experience


      NPO started back in 2003 as a website ([uitzendinggemist.nl](http://uitzendinggemist.nl)) on which live broadcasts could be replayed. The core of this product is still visible within the current platform. The lack of personalization makes it difficult to find something to watch. Episodes on tv show pages are still ordered in a lineair way, while no user starts with the last episode of a tv show.


      Personalization is essential these days in order to conquer with other streaming services. At the other hand, personalization can make it more difficult to connect and enrich the Dutch public. That's why we together with NPO transformed the platform from a generic experience to a personal experience, with control to explore all content.

      ## **Relevant content from the start**


      In order to start with a personalized homescreen on the first landing, the user is asked to select favorite tv programmes before landing on the homepage.

      ## **Prioritization of the platform structure**


      One of the design principles we created for the project states:


      NPO Start is all about the content. We are proud of that, so we are happy to give it the stage it deserves. We'd rather have you watching than search endlessly.


      That's why the menu items are prioritized from most likely to watch something to less likely to watch something:


      ∙ Home: Content of and for you (inside the bubble)\

      ∙ Explore: All content outside your current bubble.\

      ∙ Live: A tv guide which immediately throws you back in the last channel you've been watching.

        title: Menu items
  - type: textBlock
    title: ""
    body: The content rows on the homepage are also prioritized from 'most
      personalized content' to 'less personalized content'. Content rows as
      'Continue watching' and 'My favorites' are for example positioned at the
      top of the screen. This enlarges the chance to watch something as quick as
      possible, and that's after all why a user opens the NPO app.

      ## **Transparant about data**


      Another design principle we created is:


      100% trustworthy: NPO Start is 100% reliable. We handle your time, attention and data with care. We think that's completely normal. And that's why you feel completely at ease with us.


      That's why for example titles of content rows tell the user where certain recommendations are based on.

      ## **Explore content outside the bubble**


      The 'Explore tab' contains content outside the users' bubble. An extensive set of filters helps to search implicitly for something to watch within the huge amount of content.

      ## **Skip the process of searching what to watch.**


      One of the big differences between watching content via streaming services vs. television is that the process to find something to watch takes longer via streaming services. A user first needs to search for something to watch before he starts watching. When watching something on tv it's just a matter of turning on the tv and start watching. That's why we tried to copy this pattern to the NPO platform. When the user selects the 'live tab' the last watched channel opens up. The live programme starts playing (without sound).

  - type: textBlock

      ## **Exploring content without leaving the page**


      Images don't tell directly where the show is about. Users need more context in order to decide if they want to watch a certain programme. That's why we created a bottomsheet which shows a summary where the programme is about. The advantage of showing this information in a bottomsheet is that the user can explore content quickly, instead of going back and forth between pages.
