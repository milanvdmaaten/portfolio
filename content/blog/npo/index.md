      ## From a generic to a personal experience


      NPO started back in 2003 as a website ([uitzendinggemist.nl](http://uitzendinggemist.nl)) on which live broadcasts could be replayed. The core of this product is still visible within the current platform. The lack of personalization makes it difficult to find something to watch. Episodes on tv show pages are still ordered in a lineair way, while no user starts with the last episode of a tv show.


      Personalization is essential these days in order to conquer with other streaming services. At the other hand, personalization can make it more difficult to connect and enrich the Dutch public. That's why we together with NPO transformed the platform from a generic experience to a personal experience, with control to explore all content.
