      ## Roomplanner, part of Floorplanner


      Roomplanner is an extension of Floorplanner. A platform, based around a floor plan editor that runs in every browser. The tool gives users the ability to make great looking architectural visualisations of their home and interior in an easy and accessible way. Floorplanner was the first fully browser-based 2D & 3D planner, and since then over 25 million users worldwide have registered for a account and in together created over 40 million plans and a multitude of great 2D & 3D images.


      Roomplanner is embedded within home and living product webshops. Users use Roomplanner to view the webshops' products in a room they created themselves.

      ## UX interviews


      There are several challenges we faced during this project. First, the tool is not very user friendly, a lot of functionalities are spread over the tool without any hierarchy. Next to that, the visual style of Roomplanner doesn't fit the style of the webshops. Finally, the relevance for webshops to embed Roomplanner within their webshop is to generate leads. However, users don't see the point of leaving behind their email adress.



      In order to solve these challenges we conducted user interviews, and improved the design based on the insights.

      ## Adding step 1 to the step indicator


      When opening Roomplanner, users pick a room type which is followed by step 2: selecting a room shape. A step indicator shows the current step to the user. However, this indicator is missing at step 1, which implies the user starts at step 2. That's why we added the step indicator to step 1 as well.

      ## Indicators for interactive elements


      At step 2 users are asked to select a room shape, followed by step 3: the room configurator in which windows can be added and dimensions of the room can be set. Step 2 and 3 offer the possibility to add windows and doors to the room. However, test results showed that no participant made use of this functionality. That's why indicators were added to the elements that could be manipulated on the screen.

      ## 1 Task per step


      In general, the onboarding lacks of focus, and some functionalities are difficult to find. That's why we divided the onboarding in 5 steps. Each step focuses on one specific task which increases a users' focus within a specific step.

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

const saltyDuckEgg = "chinese preserved food product"
