    title: From broadcaster centered to content centered
    body: NLZIET started back in 2014 as a single access platform to all premium
      Dutch broadcasters’ streaming services and live television. That the
      service is powered by different broadcasters is directly reflected in the
      interface. Exploring new content means choosing a broadcaster to browse
      their content. This doesn’t really match how users consume television
      content as their content interests transcend broadcaster boundaries.
      That's why we together with NLZIET transformed the platform from a
      broadcaster centered platform to a content centered platform.
