      ## From broadcaster centered to content centered


      NLZIET started back in 2014 as a single access platform to all premium Dutch broadcasters’ streaming services and live television. That the service is powered by different broadcasters is directly reflected in the interface. Exploring new content means choosing a broadcaster to browse their content. This doesn’t really match how users consume television content as their content interests transcend broadcaster boundaries. That's why we together with NLZIET transformed the platform from a broadcaster-centered platform to a content-centered platform.

      ## **A personalized landing**


      Users mainly open NLZIET because they want to watch something. That's why NLZIET opens with content that fits the users' interests and inspires with similar new content.

      ## **A guide for different use cases**


      The goal of a tv guide is to get an overview of which shows have been broadcasted, are live or are upcoming. That's why the guide offers three tabs; *now and later*, *primetime*, and *everything.*

      if there's something more exciting to watch without breaking their current
      watch flow.

      ## **A different color for live and vod items**


      Live content has different properties compared to VOD content (e.g. ads, and fast forwarding). That's why the color used for the progress bar differs between these two. In this way, the user won't be surprised by seeing ads during the show.
