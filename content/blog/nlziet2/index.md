      ## **A personalized landing**


      Users open NLZIET because they want to watch something. To ensure that a user can start watching something as quickly as possible, the home screen is personalised. Only content that matches the user's watching behaviour is shown on the home screen.

      ## **A guide for different use cases**


      The goal of a tv guide is to get an overview of which shows have been broadcasted, are live or are upcoming. That's why the guide offers three tabs; *now and later*, *primetime*, and *everything.*

    body: The possibility to check the tv guide while watching helps users to check
      if there's something more exciting to watch without interrupting their
      current watch flow.

      ## **A different color for live and vod items**


      Live content has different properties compared to VOD content (e.g. ads, and fast forwarding). That's why the color used for the progress bar differs between these two. In this way, the user won't be surprised by seeing ads during the show.
