      ### A fragmented and inconsistent landscape


      NS has many different digital channels (NS app, NS.nl, NS International). Channels that were created independently of each other. Over time, this caused a fragmented and inconsistent digital landscape.\

      Goal of this project was to create a single design language. A design system available for all designers and developers working on NS products.

      ### Figma & Zeroheight


      We used Figma to discover components, and create the style- and component libraries for web and app.\

      Zeroheight was used as a documentation platform. Here we described per component its purpose, best practices, and accessibility and copy guidelines.
