      Netherlands.

    body: NS has many different digital channels. Channels that were created
      independently of each other. Over time, this has created a fragmented and
      inconsistent digital landscape. Goal of this project was to streamline the
      components (e.g. buttons, cards) used in each of these applications to one
      single component library, available for all product teams within the NS.
