      ### A fragmented and inconsistent landscape


      NS has many different digital channels (NS app, NS.nl, NS International). Channels that were created independently of each other. Over time, this caused a fragmented and inconsistent digital landscape.\

      Goal of this project was to create a single design language. A design system available for all designers and developers working on NS products.

      ### Figma & Zeroheight


      We used Figma to discover components, and create the style- and component libraries for web and app.\

      Zeroheight was used as a documentation platform. Here we described per component its purpose, best practices, and accessibility and copy guidelines.

      ### Inventorize components


      The project started with an inventarization of all the components and fundamentals that live within the digital channels of NS.

      ### Component creation process


      Each component went through a discovery and a design phase.\

      The discovery phase consists of 4 steps: Inventory, Best practices, Context, Concept.

      ### Step 1: Inventory


      During the inventory step, we looked at the work that had already been done for this component. What does the component look like in Figma and which variations of the component do we encounter within the NS environments. For this we looked at the NS Android & iOS apps and the NS website. We captured screenshots of the component and placed them under the 'inventory' step in Figma.
