    title: About me
    body: >-
      Since I was a child, I have always been busy drawing animals from books
      and pulling apart broken electronic devices my father used to own.
      Technology and design always fascinated me. Eventually my passion for
      digital design arose from this.


      Getting inspired by working together boosts my creativity when it comes to designing apps and websites. Exploring niche markets, researching new demands and needs of target audiences and turning these ideas into something tangible gives me lots of energy.


      On a personal note, involving people and making them feel comfortable is something I value. I have been playing football for nearly 15 years, it taught me how to work together in a team, but also to be open minded and honest towards my teammates.

    title: My comfort zone
    body: >-
      The last few years I've been working on the full spectrum of the design
      process. From interviewing target audiences to having discussions with
      development about pixels. I know what to do in each stage of the process
      without losing sight of business and user needs. 


      However, my skills can be used the most in the UX discovery phase. Designing and challenging different UX directions for concepts and thinking about the overall structure of digital products.
